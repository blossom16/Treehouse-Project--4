 Phrase Game

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."

Player is given a random, hiden phrase, which the player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.


Game rules:
Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
